#Programa Mentor

It is a program aimed at welcoming students from outside Catalonia,  who will make an exchange stay in UVic-UCC. It allows students and staff to engage in volunteering activities within an intercultural context and facilitates the linguistic and cultural academic integration of the host students.
If you are a mentor:

1. You will make new friends. You will meet people from all over the world and you will know what concerns they have before coming to Vic.
2. You will participate and help organize cultural and recreational activities with the incoming and host students.
3. You will practice and help practicing languages. You will know and they will help you know new cultures.
4. You will collaborate in the welcoming of the incoming students.
5. You will help them geting to know the university faculties and facilities (centers, services, groups ...).
6. You will show them the city of Vic and its surroundings.
7. You will guide the incoming students in day-to-day aspects outside the university.

In short, it will open new perspectives and you will live new experiences!

##Programa Mentor without academic recognition

The Mentor Program without academic recognition is based on your voluntary commitment to help a student host and perform various tasks prior to your arrival and during your stay at UVic-UCC. 
Among other things:
- You will participate in the joint activities of the Mentor Program in the welcome and during the academic year.
- You will have the possibility of attending a training session that will give you tools and resources to host the exchange students or students from outside Catalonia.
- You can propose activities to do with other students in the program (mentors and mentors) inside and outside the context of the university.

##Programa Mentor with academic recognition

Participation in the Mentor Program with academic recognition allows you to recognize 1 RAC credit (equivalent to 25 hours of dedication) each time, with a maximum of 2 credits. Therefore, in addition to the volunteer activities of a person committed to the reception of newcomers, this modality includes mandatory activities. 
Among other things:

- You should attend a training session.
- You must participate actively in the organization of some recreational and cultural activity.
- You must present a report at the end of the mentoring period

#Accommodation

As a Mentor you might suggest to your mentorees to see a house before taking it. Normally Erasmus come to Vic without a permanent place to live, however you should suggest them to not arrive without temporary accommodation. It is probably not a bad idea to recommend booking a hostel or a room in a residence hall for the first couple of days before arriving. 

Finding a room will be the very first thing your mentoree will worry about when they arrive to Vic. Although Vic is not a big city, every year more and more international students come and it can be hard to find a good price/quality relation on housing. 
When searching for accommodation, can be hard to find the perfect one room/flat. That's why, as a mentor, you can and should suggest some ideas about or agencies that rent rooms or houses or flats in Vic. 

Normally, faculties at UVic-UCC have a wall where students post ads for houses up for rent in Vic, so you should tell your mentorees to try and go take a look there. Also there are some Facebook pages and groups that offer renting opportunities, not only for Catalan and Spanish students, but also International Students.

Understand that, as a Mentor, the Catalan and Spanish of some of the International Students isn’t the best upon their arrival and some landlords don’t speak English, so it would be kind of you to offer your help with communication issues. Also if your mentoree already found a place but need someone to share the house with, help them finding someone by sharing that information with other mentorees or in the International Students Facebook group.

##Accommodation Tips

**Here is a checklist of points and information you should consider giving to your mentoree when seeing a house/room:**

- **Contract:** it is very hard to find accommodations with contract. A contract would made the agreement legal and you would have some responsibilities covered by law. Well, if you are not presented with a legally binding contract there is not much you can do since it is quite common. Sometimes you can also see weird contracts which are not legally binding.
- **Does the room have a window?:** It is very illegal to rent rooms without windows, so try to avoid this kind of rooms also for your own mental health. Light is important for you.
- **Price, what does include?:** Get a clear picture of what is included in the price. Normally you have or a all inclusive monthly rent for your room or room+expenses rent. Check if there is also cleaning service for the apartment and if includes only shared spaces or all the house.
- **House appliances:** Consider on the price the number of house appliances you have at your disposal, like dishwasher, which is not common but you can already find some apartments with dish washer. You should also consider other small appliances within the price evaluation (ex: toaster, juice maker etc..) although not vital, they can be useful.  Full oven with can also be missing in some apartments, very important to make frozen pizzas 3 times a week.
- **Location:** The location of the apartment also has some influence in its price.  Although Vic is a quite small city, It is always good not to be more than 15-20 mintues away from the University.
- **Flatmates:** Avoid living with persons from your country, this will limit your erasmus experience, never the less keep in touch with them, it is good to have a connection to our country. However, don't loose a good house for this reason. Having Catalan flat mates can be interesting.
- **Number of flatmates:** The bigger the apartment the more noisy it can be, however this should be compensated in the price. Compare the price/flatmates/quality ratio before making a decision. Living alone is not an option.
- **Number of toilets/showers:** Consider the number of toilets and showers in the flat, and how many rooms there are. Run away from bathrooms with two showers inside, this will be killing your privacy in no time.
- **Walking to your room:** If you need to pass through someone else's room to reach to your room, don't even think twice. It is a NO GO.
- **Fridge:** A normal fridge has a capacity for 3-5 people, depending on the size of the fridge and if they cook all together or not. Also consider if you have space for your own stuff when looking at the house. 
- **Internet:** Can you live without internet? If the house has internet, perfect. If not there is more information ahead in this guide.
- **Phone/Land Line:** It can be useful to have a land line, specially to receive calls from your country since land line calls are much cheaper. However this is expendable with skype.
- **Distance/Time to reach university:** We all know Erasmus is not only studying, however the time you take to get to your university is also important. You don't want to loose two hours per day between home and the university.
- **Can I bring a friend:** Some landlords are quite strict in letting you bring visitors to your house. Check this before renting a house, specially if you are planning to have many visits during the semester. Free stay of a guest for at least four days is quite a good thing.
- **Bed size:** The size of the bed is not vital, but It is sure nice to have a double bed if you like having someone over from time to time, or just to have more space while you sleep. This is a plus in a bedroom.
- **Parties and noise:**  Old houses will eventually be prone to more noisy since the walls are not so insulated. This will be relevant, specially when considering the neighbours, in the moment of throwing a house party/dinner. Good neighbour relations will also allow you more time before someone calls the police.

#Internet and Mobile

When moving to another country people will be meeting a lot of locals with a local number, which they might need to text or call. Your mentorees are not different. Also, we all need internet on our smartphones and not every place has free Wi-Fi yet. And, as referred in the accommodation section, the house they’ll rent might not have internet installed either.

Most apartments will already have Wi-Fi set up for tenants to use, being this is quickest and easiest option to have internet at home. However, if your mentorees find a place without internet they will need to set it up themselves. This can be difficult as the Spanish move a little slow, so it can take a few weeks.

Most of Internet Service Providers will require them to apply for a NIE and open a Spanish Bank Account in order to sign for an internet contract. However, it can be difficult to find and manage information about the types of access, contracts and fees of each an every provider. If you know any information, come forward to your mentorees and let them know. If not, just go with them and provide your support when it comes to know what’s available and the conditions of the service.

Regarding phone plans, Spain operates on a GSM network. Which means Europeans and many other countries phones will probably work in Spain. If your mentorees are coming from North America or parts of Asia, they will probably have a CDMA phone, which will not work.

If you can take them to the a phone store and show them the phone plans available and/or the phones available to them to use during their stay in Vic.

#Finance

Even if your mentorees won’t be staying in Spain for longer than six months, they will probably need ( and might come in handy) a bank account. Many phone companies and internet providers require it for registration and providing services. 

For foreigners in Spain, there are two types of bank accounts: resident and non-resident accounts. In any of them, the requirements are the same, but the fees and charges maybe differ.

There are 3 main banks in operating in Catalunya: BBVA, Banco de Sabadell and Caixabank. If possible, as a mentor, try to provide some help in this matter, as there’s the language barrier and a whole process behind opening a bank account.

In General, the requirements for opening an account are:

1. applicants must be aged 18 or over
2. photographic proof of identity (passport or National Identity Card from the country of origin for each of the applicants)
3. proof of occupation or status (employment contract/payslip, letter from accountant/lawyer, pension or disability payment confirmation, student card). This is an extra requirement introduced in 2007 by the Bank of Spain as a measure to combat money-laundering
4. residents also need to produce their Foreigner Identification Number and certificate (Número de Identificación de Extranjeros or NIE)
5. confirmation of address (utility bill, driving licence or council tax bill; proof of address must have been issued within the last 3 months)
